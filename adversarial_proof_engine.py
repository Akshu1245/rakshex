"""
Adversarial Model Debate & Empirical Proof Engine.

Rules:
1. Builder creates the solution.
2. Adversary attacks: MUST find concrete flaws, failure modes, race conditions, or unverified claims.
3. Builder Defense: Builder cannot manipulate or handwave; it MUST provide empirical evidence,
   code proofs, math, or citations to defend its work.
4. Jev 1.13 Judge: Unbiased referee evaluates the debate transcript and awards victory based
   solely on proof and correctness.
